<h3 id="subsecEvaluationMethodologyHeading">3.1 Evaluation Methodology</h3>

<p class="instructions">
{Describe what a HE is and how it was done. Write between 300 to 500
of your <em>own</em> words. Explain the method, do <em>not</em> just
list the heuristics. Replace my sample text below with your own.}
</p>


<p>
A heuristic evaluation is a usability inspection method used to look for usability errors in the ui (user interface) design. This inspection method was first described by Nielsen and Molich in 1990 [<a href="#ref-Nie1990">Nie1990</a>]. This method involves having a small set of evaluators examine the interface and judge its compliance with recognized usability principles, known as heuristics. The small set of evaluators usually consist of usability specialists. The primary goal of this evaluation is to find the usability flaws so that they can be addressed as part of an iterative design process, enhancing the overall user experience. First there were nine heuristics defined in Nielsen and Molich [1990] then some got renamed and the tenth heuristic was added in Nielsen [<a href="#ref-Nie1994">Nie1994</a>]. These heuristics and their applications are further detailed in Jakob Nielsen's guide on the subject, "Heuristic Evaluation” [<a href="#ref-Nie2022">Nie2022</a>], he also writes on the importance of these ratings in his article, "10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design," where he emphasizes the practical impact of heuristic evaluation on interface usability [<a href="#ref-Nie2024">Nie2024</a>]. For this heuristic evaluation of the website Bershka.com, the “Andrews General Usability Heuristics” were used. First each evaluator independently reviews the user interface, navigating through it as users would do under normal usage conditions. During this phase, evaluators note any deviations from these heuristics, which represent potential usability issues. Besides taking notes the evaluators also record the evaluation. Afterwards the video is cut into short 10 to 20 second clips. The notes taken by the evaluator contain a short summary of the accruing problem. After every evaluator has independently reviewed the user interface, they get together to rate each positive and negative finding. Every evaluator can rate every negative point form 0 (not a problem) to 4 (catastrophic problem) and every positive point also from 0 (not a positive) to 4 (Extremely Positive). After discussing which are the worst problems there is an executive summary of the main results written from the heuristic evaluators. This executive summary is aimed to the higher management of the tested product. The final report, which is including the executive summary and detailed findings, empowers the design team to make informed decisions about addressing and fixing usability issues.

  When adding a product to the shopping cart, users may not always intend to remove it from their favorites list, 
  as they often wish to keep certain items saved for future reference, as shown in Figure <a href="#figure-5">5</a>.
</p>

<p>
  To address this issue, consider adding a separate option for adding products to the shopping cart without removing them from the favorites list. 
  This could involve adding a checkbox or toggle button labeled 'Keep in favorites' next to the 'Add to cart' button.
